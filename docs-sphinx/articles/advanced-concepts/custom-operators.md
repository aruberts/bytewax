# Custom Operators

Have you ever wanted to implement particular weird semantic with your
operators? Or maybe support something tricky? Or you have a fever and
the only prescription is more decorators? Well with this guide you
can!

## Operator Definition

You can define new custom operators in terms of already existing
operators. To do this you define an **operator function** and decorate
it with {py:obj}`~bytewax.dataflow.operator`.

```python
from bytewax.dataflow import Stream, operator
import bytewax.operators as op


@operator
def add_to(step_id: str, up: Stream[int], y: int) -> Stream[int]:
    return op.map("shim_map", lambda x: x + y)
```

Each input or output {py:obj}`~bytewax.dataflow.Stream` turns into a
{py:obj}`~bytewax.dataflow.Port` in the resulting data model.

In order to generate the operator data model, and proper nesting of
operators, you must follow a few rules when writing your function:

- There must be a `step_id: str` argument, even if not used.

- You must create a custom {py:obj}`~dataclasses.dataclass` to return
  multiple values or down streams. You can return a single
  {py:obj}`~bytewax.dataflow.Stream` or `None` as well if you need a
  single or no down streams.

- All arguments, the return value, and return
  {py:obj}`~dataclasses.dataclass` fields that are
  {py:obj}`~bytewax.dataflow.Stream`s must have type annotations. We
  recommend annotating all the arguments, the return value, and all
  fields in a return {py:obj}`~dataclasses.dataclass`.

- Argument and return {py:obj}`~dataclasses.dataclass` field names
  must not overlap with the names defined on the
  {py:obj}`~bytewax.dataflow.Operator` base class.

- {py:obj}`~bytewax.dataflow.Stream`s and
  {py:obj}`~bytewax.dataflow.Dataflow`s _must not appear in nested
  objects_: they either can be arguments, the return type directly, or
  the top-level fields of a {py:obj}`~dataclasses.dataclass` that is
  the return type; nowhere else.

## Docstrings

A good docstring for a custom operator has a few things:

- A one line summary of the operator.

- A doctest example using the operator.

- Any arguments that are streams describe the required shape of that
  upstream.

- The return streams describe the shape of the data that is being sent
  downstream.
